The ideal pairing is Clos Ste.-Hune, but on more of a budget, the Frédéric Emile works great too! The level of acidity in Riesling can trick your mouth into thinking it’s tannin! This way, the texture of the wine works great with a piece of steak. [...] Surprisingly, my most unexpected steak pairing is rosé Champagne. Well-structured rosé Champagne can stand up to leaner cuts of beef and create an entirely different gastronomic experience. Great acid and slight tannins in complex, vinous rosé Champagne can support the steak and leave the guest more refreshed. Vintage Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé Cuvée Elisabeth, vintage Pol Roger Brut Rosé and vintage Paul Bara Brut Rosé Spécial Club come immediately to mind. [...] Right now, Carignan has become my absolute favorite steak wine. While it always makes sense to have big bold reds like Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, I find it appealing to lean the other way with a nice contrasting flavor profile to the steak. Carignan—especially from Itata Valley, Chile—tends to have this bright acidity that acts as a palate cleanser between bites of steak, with the classic spice shining through at the end making you want to go back for more beef. It’s a delightful cycle.\", \"score\": 0.9123193, \"raw_content\": \"[WhiskyFest New York is Back Nov. 14!

Roundtable](/display/sommelier-roundtable)\\n\\n# 32 Unexpected Steak and Wine Pairings Recommended by Wine Pros\\n\\n15 sommeliers share surprising bottles that pair beautifully with beef, from Aglianico to rosé Champagne and even Alsatian Riesling\\n\\nBy \\n\\n* [Julia Larson](/authors/julia-larson)\\n\\nIt’s simple wine logic: Beef needs big reds. Or does it? Sommeliers across the country have successfully broken the mold with their wine pairings, going beyond beloved classics like steak and [Cabernet Sauvignon](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/cabernet-sauvignon-57803), and experimenting with a gamut of lighter reds, sparklers and, dare we say it, white wines and sweeter wines. To get some prime tips, *Wine Spectator* reached out to sommeliers who run award-winning [steak house](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/top-steak-houses-for-wine-lovers) wine programs from Boston to Seattle, asking what bottles they would suggest for an adventurous wine lover to pair with steak. From Washington’s Rhône-style reds to young ruby Port, these pairings are a cut above the rest!\\n\\n**Steven McDonald, executive beverage director for Grand Award-winning Pappas Bros. Steakhouses in [Dallas](https://restaurants.winespectator.com/restaurant/559/pappas-bros-steakhouse-dallas) and [Houston](https://restaurants.winespectator.com/restaurant/401/pappas-bros-steakhouse-houston)**\\n\\nSurprisingly, my most unexpected steak pairing is [rosé Champagne](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/rose-vintage-champagne-ny-wine-experience-2023). Well-structured rosé Champagne can stand up to leaner cuts of beef and create an entirely different gastronomic experience. Great acid and slight tannins in complex, vinous rosé Champagne can support the steak and leave the guest more refreshed. Vintage [Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé Cuvée Elisabeth](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Billecart-Salmon+Brut+Ros%C3%A9+Champagne+Elisabeth+Salmon), vintage [Pol Roger Brut Rosé](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Pol+Roger+Brut+Ros%C3%A9) and vintage [Paul Bara Brut Rosé Spécial Club](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Paul+Bara+Brut+Ros%C3%A9) come immediately to mind.\\n\\nJonathan Kearns curates the wine program for an Italian-American steak house in Nashville.  (Courtesy of Carne Mare)\\n\\n**Jonathan Kearns, wine director of Best of Award of Excellence winner [Carne Mare](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/6885/carne-mare) in Nashville**\\n\\nI love to reach for the somewhat lesser-known [Aglianico](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Aglianico) wines from [Campania and Basilicata](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/aglianico-57634). The wines are incredibly diverse in style, from the somewhat lighter and more red fruited style of Marco Tinessa’s Ognostro to the power of the [Quintodecimo](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Quintodecimo+Aglianico) wines and the rustic nobility of the classic [Mastroberardino Radici](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/classic-campani-a-mastroberardino-vertical-tasting-103123) bottlings. This always assertive, yet distinctly Italian varietal has the range to match any piece of beef you pair alongside it.\\n\\n**[Victoria James](https://www.winespectator.com/article/sommelier-talk-how-victoria-james-keeps-growing-cote-korean-steakhouse), executive beverage director at Best Award of Excellence–winning Cote Korean Steakhouses in [Miami](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/6200/cote-miami) and [New York City](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/4974/cote-korean-steakhouse), and [Coqodaq](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/coqodaq-restaurant-opens-in-new-york-with-400-champagne-wine-list) in New York City**\\n\\nAt Cote Korean Steakhouse, we love a good bottle of Burgundy. Leaner reds, for sure, but for an unexpected pairing, a [white Burgundy](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/burgundy-s-elegant-2020s-tasting-report-101523) is a revelation with steak and *banchan* [small side dishes]. You want freshness but also a little oxidation and perhaps age, so we are seeing more people go towards heftier whites with their red meats! Favorite white Burgundies with age like Ampeau, [Dujac](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Dujac), [Domaine Roulot](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Roulot), and [A&P de Villaine](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=A%26P+de+Villaine) are flying off the cellar shelves.\\n\\n**[Andy Chabot](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/sommelier-talk-andy-chabot-blackberry-farm-tennessee), senior vice president of food and beverage at Grand Award winner [Blackberry Farm](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/556/blackberry-farm), Walland, Tenn.**\\n\\nI’ve done several tastings that focus on this very question. Or rather, focus on trying different wines with a bit of steak. The main theme that always shows is it’s not the steak, it’s the sauce that really matters. When you use a Hollandaise or Béarnaise sauce, a white Burgundy or [American Chardonnay](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/fresh-start-california-chardonnay-tasting-report-073123) with oak is great! When you have an [au poivre](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/valentines-day-steak-au-poivre-recipe-red-wine-pairings) sauce, try a [young ruby Port](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/wine-tip-dr-vinnys-port-primer-44198)—it’ll change your life. Tomato-based sauce? Sangiovese from Tuscany! [This can include [Chianti](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/tasting-report-on-the-wines-of-tuscany-italy-103123) and [Brunello](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/going-old-school-tasting-report-on-the-wines-of-brunello-di-montalcino-063023).] When trying steak with an olive tapenade or puttanesca type of sauce, lean on [Syrah](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/syrah-57816) from [Sonoma Coast](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Sonoma+Coast+Syrah) or the Northern Rhône. It’s endlessly surprising how the steak somewhat fades into the background and the pairing is actually based on the wine and the sauce.\\n\\n**Simon Roberts, co-owner and beverage director at Award of Excellence winner [Tango Room](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/6901/tango-room), Dallas**\\n\\nI recently paired the Sine Qua Non Distenta 11 2020 [[a Rhône blend](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/on-the-rebound-california-rhone-style-wines-tasting-report-101523) from Ventura County, California] with a classic N.Y Strip. It’s a [Grenache](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/grenache-57807)-based red that reminds me of the great [Chteau Rayas](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Ch%C3%A2teau+Rayas) from Chteauneuf-de-Pape. It shows pretty, big red fruit on the palate, and it’s extremely well-balanced. It was a superb complement to the steak; at Tango, chef Corrin Ellis has a secret seasoning that is celery salt–based and added after the sear. It marries perfectly with a nuanced red like Sine Qua Non Grenache.\\n\\n**[Alex Cuper](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/sommelier-talk-alex-cuper-homes-in-on-south-american-wines-in-the-windy-city), beverage director of Award of Excellence winner [El Che](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/5925/el-che-steakhouse-%26-bar) and recently opened [Brasero](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/restaurant-news-chicago-is-getting-a-new-restaurant-from-chef-john-manion) in Chicago**\\n\\nRight now, Carignan has become my absolute favorite steak wine. While it always makes sense to have big bold reds like [Malbec](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/malbec-57808) and Cabernet Sauvignon, I find it appealing to lean the other way with a nice contrasting flavor profile to the steak. Carignan—especially from [Itata Valley, Chile](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/brave-new-world-tasting-report-on-the-red-wines-of-chile-053123)—tends to have this bright acidity that acts as a palate cleanser between bites of steak, with the classic spice shining through at the end making you want to go back for more beef. It’s a delightful cycle.\\n\\nAmy Mundwiler runs distinctive steak-friendly wine cellars in Chicago and Scottsdale, Ariz.  (Courtesy of Maple & Ash)\\n\\n**Amy Mundwiler, national director of wine and beverage for Best of Award of Excellence winners Maple & Ash in [Chicago](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/4139/maple-%26-ash) and [Scottsdale, Ariz.](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/5843/maple-%26-ash)**\\n\\nMy absolute favorite thing to do is offer up sexy alternatives to what people usually pair with our cuts of beef. The go-to is Cabernet Sauvignon, and while that isn't a wrong answer, there are a few other showstoppers that I *love* to turn people on to. A high-acid, high-tannin Barolo with some age, a peppery Syrah from the Rhône. We have an IDGAF wine pairing option at Maple & Ash where the guest leaves things completely in our hands, and that’s when we go in with a few surprises. If you have an open mind, we’re gonna blow your mind!\\n\\n**Thomas Kakalios, wine director of Award of Excellence winner [Asador Bastian](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/6698/asador-bastian) in Chicago**\\n\\nPairing a [Blanc de Noirs](https://www.winespectator.com/glossary/show/id/blanc_de_noirs) sparkling wine from a small grower-producer—be it [Cava](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/sparkling-personalities-guide-to-global-sparkling-wine-063023) or [Champagne](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/2023-champagne-wine-tasting-report-121523)—with a Basque feast culminating in our iconic *txuletón* [large rib] steaks is a knockout pairing. Our guests allow us to curate tastings for them, focusing on seafood, seasonal vegetables and, of course, beef. The elevated acidity and effervescence of sparkling wine acts like a natural reset button for the palate, allowing each bite to taste like the first bite. Blanc de Noirs wines appear white but are made entirely from red grapes, so have the structure to stand up to a beautiful cut of meat, but the versatility to showcase the nuanced flavors coming from our kitchen.\\n\\n**Henk Schuitemaker, wine director of Grand Award winner [Angus Barn](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/19/the-angus-barn) in Raleigh, N.C.**\\n\\nI had invited two great friends over for a steak dinner at my house—I was grilling some Angus Barn ribeyes. They brought over several bottles of Klet Brda Bagueri [Ribolla Gialla](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Ribolla+Gialla) from [Slovenia](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Slovenia). I was completely intrigued, especially when I found this to be a wonderful match with the steak. High acid cut through the fat of the steak and the wine’s full body matched the weight of the steak. Lovely citrus and mineral finish enhanced the flavors of both the meat and the wine.\\n\\n**Renato Bringas, wine director for Best of Award of Excellence winner [Andiron](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/6902/andiron) in Houston**\\n\\nLiving in Texas, where the weather stays warm for much of the year, I often find myself drawn to [Cerasuolo d’Abruzzo](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Cerasuolo+d%27Abruzzo) [a rosé from Italy]. Its refreshing qualities and balanced acidity make it a great choice, especially when paired with steak, providing both refreshment and a satisfying dining experience in the heat.\\n\\nAt Barolo Grill, Ryan Fletter manages a wine list that has held a Grand Award since 2018.  (Courtesy of Barolo Grill)\\n\\n**Ryan Fletter, beverage director of Grand Award winner [Barolo Grill](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/298/barolo-grill) in Denver**\\n\\nIn one of my many Italian sojourns, I stumbled upon a Langhe [Nebbiolo](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/nebbiolo-57810) from G.D. Vajra called [Clare J.C](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/alt-nebbiolo-anyone-thomas-jefferson-barolo-and-giuseppe-vaira) and what is fascinating is that it is made by partial [whole cluster fermentation](https://www.winespectator.com/glossary/show/id/whole_cluster)! Nebbiolo typically lends itself to big structured wines like Barolo and [Barbaresco](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/difference-between-barolo-barbaresco-barbera-brunello-57773), but this one speaks rather like great Beaujolais. Try having beef *tagliata* sliced on the plate paired with this red wine; the aroma is floral like violets and crunchy like pomegranates. It also has an earthiness of fresh mushrooms and truffles and finishes with a zippy acidity that just makes your mouth salivate.\\n\\n**Chris Lara, wine director of Grand Award winner [Metropolitan Grill](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/220/metropolitan-grill) in Seattle**\\n\\nSteak and wine have become my life. While we enjoy bringing the usual favorites like [Silver Oak](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Silver+Oak) or [Caymus](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Caymus) or [Leonetti](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Leonetti), we also like to have a \\\"trick\\\" up our sleeves for those willing to venture. One of these wines—an all-around crowd-pleaser from Washington, in the Southern Rhône-style category—is Upsidedown’s “Gold Drop,” a Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah blend. This wine has it all: Incredible fruit profile, attractive tannins (the all-important pairing with steak), and a long, yet elegant finish. Another wine, especially with filet mignon, is Valfaccenda’s Roero Rosso Riserva from the famed Valmaggiore vineyard. Baby Barolo in all but name and without the steep price tag. It’s a firm Nebbiolo structure that will hold up to a lean cut like filet mignon or a richer cut like a sirloin from [Snake River Farms](https://www.snakeriverfarms.com/).\\n\\n**Hugo Bensimon, beverage director for Grand Award winner [Grill 23 & Bar](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/185/grill-23-%26-bar) in Boston**\\n\\nMy best unexpected wine pairing with steak is Alsatian [Riesling](https://www.winespectator.com/articles/riesling-57813), more specifically [Trimbach](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Trimbach). The ideal pairing is [Clos Ste.-Hune](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Clos+Ste.-Hune), but on more of a budget, the [Frédéric Emile](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Trimbach+Frederic+Emile) works great too! The level of acidity in Riesling can trick your mouth into thinking it’s tannin! This way, the texture of the wine works great with a piece of steak.\\n\\n**Clarke Anderson, beverage director for Rocket Farm Restaurants, including Best of Award of Excellence winner [Marcel](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/2621/marcel) in Atlanta and Award of Excellence winner [State of Grace](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/2581/state-of-grace) in Houston**\\n\\nWhile we sometimes think of red Burgundy as a lighter-bodied wine, there are ‘beefy’ wines coming from villages like [Corton-Charlemagne](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Corton-Charlemagne), [Volnay](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Volnay) and [Pommard](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&page=1&winery=Pommard&text_search_flag=everything&search_by=all&scorelow=-1&scorehigh=-1&pricelow=-1&pricehigh=-1&case_prod=null_case_prod&accolade%5B%5D=&taste_date=&issue_date=&issue_year=&varietal%5B%5D=null_varietal&regions%5B%5D=null_regions&vintage%5B%5D=&size=15&sort_by=date&sort_dir=desc). Ask your sommelier to help you choose a selection from Burgundy that has the power, structure and body that your steak needs. Some will overlook the [Beaune](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&page=1&winery=Beaune&text_search_flag=everything&search_by=all&scorelow=-1&scorehigh=-1&pricelow=-1&pricehigh=-1&case_prod=null_case_prod&accolade%5B%5D=&taste_date=&issue_date=&issue_year=&varietal%5B%5D=null_varietal&regions%5B%5D=null_regions&vintage%5B%5D=&size=15&sort_by=date&sort_dir=desc) when pairing with red meat, but the finesse of Pinot Noir can make a steak so much more enjoyable and celebrate the flavor of the beef.\\n\\n**Dylan Amos, wine director of Grand Award winner [Delmonico Steakhouse](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/552/delmonico-steakhouse) and Best of Award of Excellence winner [Emeril’s New Orleans Fish House](https://www.winespectator.com/restaurants/283/emeril's-new-orleans-fish-house), Las Vegas**\\n\\nI just can’t get enough of A5 Wagyu and [Dom Pérignon](https://www.winespectator.com/wine/search?submitted=Y&scope=ratings&winery=Dom+Perignon). The complexity of the beverage and the meat makes a very happy marriage. Dom’s phenolic bitterness melts as its structural elements are completed by the Wagyu’s intense marbling. This is true decadence and also works very well on an intellectual level.\\n\\n[steak-beef](/tags/steak-beef) [Red Wines](/tags/red-wines) [White Wines](/tags/white-wines) [Sparkling Wines](/tags/sparkling-wines) [Rosé](/tags/rose) [Dining Out](/tags/dining-out) [Restaurant Awards](/tags/restaurant-awards) [People](/categories/people)\\n\\n## You Might Also Like\\n\\n[People](/categories/people \\\"People\\\")\\n\\n### [At Napa’s Auberge du Soleil, Katharina Marrapode Has Big Shoes to Fill](/articles/wine-interview-sommelier-katharina-marrapode-auberge-du-soleil-napa-valley \\\"At Napa’s Auberge du Soleil, Katharina Marrapode Has Big Shoes to Fill\\\")\\n\\nTaking over from veteran somm Kris Margerum, Marrapode is making an impact on a landmark …\\n\\n* [Aaron Romano](/authors/aromano)\\n\\nSep 26, 2025\\n\\n[People](/categories/people \\\"People\\\")\\n\\n### [At Kermit’s Table, Part 1](/articles/at-the-table-with-wine-importer-kermit-lynch-part-1 \\\"At Kermit’s Table, Part 1\\\")\\n\\nA creative spirit of wine releases his first novel—set in France’s vineyards\\n\\n* [Robert Camuto](/authors/rcamuto)\\n\\nSep 17, 2025\\n\\n[People](/categories/people \\\"People\\\")\\n\\n### [Mets Home Run King Pete Alonso’s Favorite Italian Reds](/articles/new-york-mets-pete-alonso-favorite-italian-red-wine \\\"Mets Home Run King Pete Alonso’s Favorite Italian Reds\\\")\\n\\nThe All-Star first baseman, introduced to wine by his refugee Spanish grandfather, …\\n\\n* [Robert Taylor](/authors/rtaylor)\\n\\nSep 12, 2025\\n\\n[People](/categories/people \\\"People\\\")\\n\\n### [The Future of Vieux Télégraphe](/articles/the-future-of-domaine-du-vieux-telegraphe \\\"The Future of Vieux Télégraphe\\\")\\n\\nA Chteauneuf-du-Pape icon looks forward and back\\n\\n* [Robert Camuto](/authors/rcamuto)\\n\\nSep 3, 2025\\n\\n[People](/categories/people \\\"People\\\")\\n\\n### [Charles Everett Is Shining a Light on Black-Owned Wine Brands](/articles/charles-everett-is-shining-a-light-on-black-owned-wine-brands \\\"Charles Everett Is Shining a Light on Black-Owned Wine Brands\\\")\\n\\nThe Washington, D.C.–based entrepreneur talks about how his personal passion for Black-owne…\\n\\n* [MaryAnn Worobiec](/authors/mworobiec)\\n\\nAug 27, 2025\\n\\n[People](/categories/people \\\"People\\\")\\n\\n### [Down to Earth in Chteauneuf-du-Pape](/articles/down-to-earth-at-chateauneuf-du-pape-domaine-de-la-janasse \\\"Down to Earth in Chteauneuf-du-Pape\\\")\\n\\nAt Domaine de la Janasse, the family’s success is based on a unique mosaic of terroirs\\n\\n* [Robert Camuto](/authors/rcamuto)\\n\\nAug 19, 2025\\n\\n### Free Wine Spectator Email Newsletters\\n\\nSign Up for Wine Spectator’s Free Email Newsletters and stay up-to-date with all things wine.\\n\\n [Explore Newsletters](http://newsletters.winespectator.com/)\\n\\n## Restaurant Search\\n\\n## Wine Spectator Podcasts\\n\\n* [Get the App](https://www.winespectator.com/podcasts \\\"Download Wine Spectator Podcasts\\\")\\n\\n \"}, {\"title\": \"Best wine with steak: What to choose - Decanter\", \"url\": \"https://www.decanter.com/learn/advice/wine-steak-ask-decanter-400770/\", \"content\": \"Food-and-wine-pairing expert and Decanter contributing editor, Fiona Beckett agrees.

With their lush dark fruit and naturally high tannins, Malbec wines and blends are a safe choice if you’re unsure what to buy.\\n\\nTwo main regions should be on your radar. First is [**Argentina**](https://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews-tastings/wine-panel-tastings/premium-argentinian-malbec-panel-tasting-results-2-527820/), the New World country that has become synonymous with quality Malbec at all price points. The region of [**Mendoza**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/mendoza/) has more Malbec planted than anywhere else in the world. It’s home to 76% of Argentina’s vineyards and Malbec plantings here account for one-fifth of the total Malbec in the country. So look out for the name on wine labels.\\n\\nSince Argentina is also famous for the production of high-quality beef, it’s no surprise that steak and Malbec have found a perfect partnership here. The classic style of Argentinian Malbec is an oaked wine packed with layers of dark fruit and spice. But it’s also worth considering fresher styles.\\n\\n‘I tend to choose a “new wave” [**Malbec**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/malbec/), one with less oak, fresher fruit and better acidity,’ says South American wine expert Patricio Tapia, editor of the annual *Guida Descorchados*. ‘Especially ones coming from places like [**Altamira**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/paraje-altamira-the-geographic-indication-that-transformed-argentinas-terroirs-20-wines-tasted-509768/) and Gualtallary in the [**Uco Valley**](https://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews-tastings/uco-valley-wines-12-essential-ones-to-try-446346/), towards the Andes Mountains.’ he added. ‘Always keep in mind that the main task for a glass of wine is to refresh the food.’\\n\\nThe other region to seek out for top Malbec is the grape’s French homeland of [**Cahors**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/discovering-cahors-40-wines-tasted-and-rated-434489/). Although this region in southwest France doesn’t produce as much Malbec as Argentina, it can be a good source of value bottles, with styles ranging from the traditional gutsy and full-bodied to light and fruity.\\n\\n### Cabernet Sauvignon: a classic choice\\n\\nSliced steak with rosemary and roasted garlic Credit: VICUSCHKA / Moment / Getty Images\\n\\nAnother great option if you’re looking to pour a full-bodied red wine, is **[Cabernet Sauvignon.](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/cabernet-sauvignon/)** A winning combination of dark fruits, tannin and naturally high acidity makes Cabernet and Cabernet-dominant blends a successful partner for steak.\\n\\nThe most classic of Cabernet regions is [**Bordeaux,**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/bordeaux-wines/) whose red wines are also known as [**claret**](https://www.decanter.com/learn/advice/what-is-claret-wine-ask-decanter-378401/). More Cabernet Sauvignon is planted on the Left Bank, so these wines will be richer in style. Right Bank Bordeaux is Merlot-dominant so the wines will be more supple. But both varieties are planted throughout Bordeaux so claret is usually a blend of the two.\\n\\nFrance isn’t the only source of Cabernet Sauvignon however. This adaptable grape is successfully grown all over the world from [**Australia**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/australian-cabernet-sauvignon-panel-tasting-results-470457/) and [**China**](https://www.decanter.com/decanter-world-wine-awards/chinese-new-year-15-award-winning-chinese-wines-to-try-453414/) to [**South Africa**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/south-african-cabernet-sauvignon-40-wines-to-buy-441394/) and [**California**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/california-cabernet-sauvignon-2017-and-2018-panel-tasting-results-476083/). ‘A powerful California Cabernet Sauvignonwith a grilled steak is pretty hard to beat,’ says US wine expert Karen MacNeil in her [**10 rules to food and wine pairing**](https://www.decanter.com/learn/food/recipes-2/food-and-wine/the-10-rules-of-food-and-wine-pairing-by-karen-macneil-289376/).\\n\\n### Syrah to Pinotage: more red options\\n\\nCredit: Instants / E+ / Getty Images\\n\\n‘I’d urge people to look beyond the traditional matches of Malbec or Cabernet Sauvignon with steak,’ says wine writer and DWWA judge Peter Richards MW. ‘The risk with steak is to think big meaty flavours equals big wine,’ he adds.\\n\\n‘How about a nice lively [**Cabernet Franc**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/cabernet-franc/)? Or may even a [**Carignan**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/carignan/), [**Cinsault**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/cinsault/) or cool-climate [**Syrah**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/shiraz-syrah/)? Even a full-bodied but elegant rosé can work well on a warm day,’ says Richards.\\n\\nWith its spicy black pepper notes, Syrah – also known as Shiraz – is a particularly good match for the smoky flavours of steak cooked on a barbecue. Generous [**Australian Shiraz**](https://www.decanter.com/decanter-best/best-australian-shiraz-under-25-to-buy-449893/) is a reliably good pairing. While classic examples from the [**Rhône Valley**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/rhone-valley/) in France will often have a delicious savoury smoky bacon note too.\\n\\nSouth Africa is also a source of great Syrah/Shiraz for steak – look out for examples from [**Swartland**](https://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews/search/swartland/page/1/4). While smoky [**South African Pinotage**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/south-african-pinotage-panel-tasting-results-471719/) is another natural fit for flame-grilled steaks.\\n\\nIf you’re keen to experiment, there’s a long list of native grapes from countries around the world that would suit steak. Portugal’s gutsy [**Douro Valley reds**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/douro-red-wines-panel-tasting-results-494591/) are usually field blends of local varieties such as [**Touriga Nacional**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/touriga-nacional/) and Tinta Roriz. Or how about [**Sangiovese**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/sangiovese/) from Italy?\\n\\n### **Four classic** **red grapes for steak**\\n\\n* **Malbec**\\n* **Cabernet Sauvignon**\\n* **Syrah / Shiraz**\\n* **Pinotage**\\n\\n### **Does Pinot Noir go with steak?**\\n\\nMost **[Pinot Noir](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/pinot-noir/)** wines tend to sit at the light- to medium-bodied end of the flavour spectrum. So its profile is often therefore paired-up with lighter meats sand white meat. Yet Pinot Noir’s natural acidity and bright, red berry fruit can work with your steak dinner, depending on the style and the cut.\\n\\nIn general, think about trying Pinots with leaner cuts of beef, such as fillet, which are cooked rare to medium-rare. Steak tartare will go nicely with a Pinot Noir for example.\\n\\n### **Ribeye or fillet steak?**\\n\\nBarbecue bone-in ribeye steak Credit: istetiana / Moment / Getty Images\\n\\n‘The easiest way to pair wine with beef is to think about matching the flavour intensity of your wine with your beef,’ says Mark Quick, wine director for the Hawksmoor group of steakhouse restaurants, in this in-depth article about **[pairing wine with beef](https://www.decanter.com/learn/food/christmas-beef-wine-pairing-tips-351001/)**.\\n\\nConsider the fat content in your meat, for example. ‘More fat equals more intense beefy flavour,’ says Quick.\\n\\nFood-and-wine-pairing expert and *Decanter* contributing editor, Fiona Beckett agrees. She recommends pairing a ribeye steak with its relatively high fat content with a Syrah-based Côte-Rôtie from the Northern Rhône or a SuperTuscan Italian red – ‘both generous, ripe and full-bodied’.\\n\\nMeanwhile she recommends riper, more fruit-driven styles of red for steak cooked well-done.\\n\\n### **What sauce?**\\n\\nBéarnaise sauce Credit: svariophoto / iStock / Getty Images Plus\\n\\nServing a sauce with any meat will influence the wine pairing. Common choices for steak include béarnaise, peppercorn sauce, spicy South American chimichurri, mushroom sauce or mustard.\\n\\n‘Sauces and sides will also be just as important when it comes to the choice of wine,’says Richards. ‘Creamy sauces like béarnaise can go well with an oakier wine. Syrah can work well with peppercorns.’\\n\\n‘For peppercorn sauce, as it’s so rich I would suggest a plummy and fruity Malbec, a Bordeaux, a reserva Rioja or a nice medium- to full-bodied Douro red,’ adds Alberto Almeida, head sommelier at Lainston House. ‘With béarnaise, maybe something with a bit more acidity and tannin, such as a Brunello di Montalcino made with the Sangiovese grape.’\\n\\nLorenzo Tili, head sommelier at The Goring agrees. ‘Bérnaise sauce requires a red wine with pronounced flavour intensity, full body, good tannins and enough acidity to cut through the sweet meat and creaminess given from the sauce. Sangiovese will always deliver very well. He suggests [**Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Riserva**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/vino-nobile-di-montepulciano-2020-riserva-2019-new-releases-in-2023-502610/) and [**Chianti Classico Gran Selezione**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-new-releases-in-2024-528502/) from Tuscany, or Torgiano Rosso Riserva from Umbria.\\n\\n‘With spicy sauces like chimichurri, we want to pair a smooth red with round tannins. But pay attention at the abv,’ warns Tili. ‘If the alcohol is too high, it will increase the spicy sensation of the food on the palate – in particular with red hot chilli – and the result won’t be pleasant!’\\n\\n### **White wine with steak?**\\n\\nIf you aren’t a fan of red wines, can you pair steak with white wines or rosés? The answer is yes, as long as you go for fuller-bodied examples. Think oaked Chardonnay or [**Cerasuolo d’Abruzzo**](https://www.decanter.com/decanter-best/cerasuolo-dabruzzo-italys-serious-rose-444186/), a characterful Italian rosé made from Montepulciano, with cherry and savoury flavours.\\n\\nDiscovery is, after all, one of the most exciting things about the wine world. Experienced sommelier Matthieu Longuère MS, wine development manager at Le Cordon Bleu London, suggests mature white Rioja in his article about  **[pairing white wine with red meat](https://www.decanter.com/learn/food/cordon-bleu/red-meat-with-white-wine-321407/)**.\\n\\n‘To pair with steak, I would go for a deep rosé, made with Malbec, Shiraz or  [**Merlot**](https://www.decanter.com/wine/grape-varieties/merlot/) grapes,’ says Almeida. ‘The dark colour shows more contact with the skins, so we’ll have a more robust and tannic wine to help the protein of the steak.’\\n\\n‘Look for a wine characterised by full body and good structure,’ agrees Tili. ‘A blend from the Southern Rhône appellation of [**Tavel**](https://www.decanter.com/premium/walls-tavel-and-its-unexpected-revolution-478636/) (mainly Grenache and Cinsault with other local varieties) would certainly be one of the best options. Alternatively a rosé made from Aglianico and Sagrantino grapes, which are very rich in polyphenols, from Central and Southern Italy would also perform very well.’\\n\\nIf you’re still undecided on which wine to choose, here are some recommendations from the Decanter team, to suit every pocket and occasion – from special celebrations to budget mid-week suppers…\\n\\n### **Best wines for steak: 12 to try**\\n\\n{}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"55366\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"81868\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"42117\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"83440\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"65198\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"80283\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"55842\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"80292\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"57097\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{\\\"wineId\\\":\\\"69416\\\",\\\"displayCase\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"paywall\\\":true}\\n\\n{}\\n\\n### **Related articles**\\n\\n### [**Premium Argentinian Malbec: Panel tasting results**](https://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews-tastings/wine-panel-tastings/premium-argentinian-malbec-panel-tasting-results-2-527820/)\\n\\n### [Value Argentinian Malbec: panel tasting results](https://www.decanter.com/wine-reviews-tastings/wine-panel-tastings/value-argentinian-malbec-panel-tasting-results-482782/)\\n\\n### [**See all food and wine pairing articles**](https://www.decanter.com/learn/food/)\\n\\n## Latest Wine News\\n\\n* [### Historic appeal: Global wine leaders unite against WHO’s ‘denormalisation’ push at UN summit](https://www.decanter.com/wine/historic-appeal-global-wine-leaders-unite-against-whos-denormalisation-push-at-un-summit-566028/ \\\"Historic appeal: Global wine leaders unite against WHO’s ‘denormalisation’ push at UN summit\\\")\\n* [### Decanter Hall of Fame and Rising Star 2025 winners revealed](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/decanter-hall-of-fame-and-rising-star-2025-winners-revealed-565961/ \\\"Decanter Hall of Fame and Rising Star 2025 winners revealed\\\")\\n* [### Decanter sponsors ‘Wine Professional of the Year’ at the 2025 BIH Spotlight Awards](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/decanter-sponsors-wine-professional-of-the-year-at-the-2025-bih-spotlight-awards-565826/ \\\"Decanter sponsors ‘Wine Professional of the Year’ at the 2025 BIH Spotlight Awards\\\")\\n* [### ‘I tasted over 100 Vin Santo wines, here are the ones to buy’](https://www.decanter.com/premium/i-tasted-over-100-vin-santo-wines-here-are-the-ones-to-buy-565615/ \\\"‘I tasted over 100 Vin Santo wines, here are the ones to buy’\\\")\\n* [### Willem Dafoe teams up with Laphroaig: Discover the flavours behind ‘The Taste’ campaign](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/laphroaig-announces-new-celebrity-partnership-565713/ \\\"Willem Dafoe teams up with Laphroaig: Discover the flavours behind ‘The Taste’ campaign\\\")\\n\\n \"}, {\"title\": \"Guide to Wine and Steak Pairings\", \"url\": \"https://charkoals.com/guide-to-wine-and-steak-pairings/\", \"content\": \"A lighter-bodied Pinot Noir pairs well with a lighter cut of steak, like Filet Mignon.

If you’re looking to elevate your dining experience, knowing which wine pairs the best with your steak is essential. Below, we share five of the best wine with steak pairings you need to know.  But remember, the perfect pairing begins with understanding your steak. \\n\\n## **A Note on Steaks**\\n\\nEach cut boasts its own unique flavor profile, but we believe two primary factors dictate which steak should be paired with which wine: fattiness and seasonings. Fattiness significantly influences the overall flavor and texture of the meat. A key principle to remember is the fattier the steak, the bolder the wine. Equally important is the seasonings, as they can enhance or complement the natural richness of the steak. \\n\\nNow, let’s uncork the secrets of the perfect wine pairings you can order at a Brazilian steakhouse to enhance your dining experience.\\n\\n## **The** **Best Wine With Steak**\\n\\nAt Gaucho’s Prime, we’re incredibly proud of our extensive and selective wine collection. We have over 100 different wines to enjoy with your meal from various regions and grape varieties. Below, you will find some of our favorite wines to pair with our signature USDA [prime meats](https://charkoals.com/prime-meats/).  \\n\\n#### **Cabernets**\\n\\nKnown for their bold and robust flavor, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are the frontrunners of the red wine world. The deep, complex flavors of Cabernets make them an ideal companion for hearty steaks. At Gaucho’s Prime, we recommend pairing a Ribeye with a well-aged Cabernet. The wine’s tannin cut through the meat’s richness, creating a satisfying and indulgent balance.      \\n\\n#### **Malbec**\\n\\nMalbec wines offer a velvety texture and rich, dark fruit flavors. We recommend pairing a Malbec with our tender Filet Mignon. The wine’s lush profile complements the steak’s tenderness, creating a sumptuous pairing. \\n\\n#### **Pinot Noir**\\n\\nA lighter-bodied Pinot Noir pairs well with a lighter cut of steak, like Filet Mignon. The wine is known for its delicate flavors of cherry, raspberry, and earthy tones that won’t overpower the subtle taste of the meat. For richer cuts of steak, like Ribeye, you’ll want a Pinot Noir with a bit more body and tannins. Look for wines from warmer regions like California or Argentina. These wines have deep flavors of black cherry, plum, and spice that can stand up to the bold flavor of the steak.\\n\\n#### **Syrah (Shiraz)**\\n\\nSyrah, also known as Shiraz, boasts a bold, peppery taste that stands up to the richness of a steak. Try a glass of Syrah when dining on a juicy Ribeye or Fraldinha. \\n\\n## **Drink and Dine at Gaucho’s Prime**\\n\\nRemember, these are just guidelines; you can always pair your steak with a different wine or even try a cocktail. Experiment, explore, and enjoy! At Gaucho’s Prime, we’re a Brazilian steakhouse boasting an extensive selection of wines to pair perfectly with your meal. Our gauchos can offer personalized recommendations based on your steak selection and flavor preferences.

      "커피는 중동과 북아프리카를 거쳐 16세기에 유럽으로 확산되었으며, 가장 일반적으로 재배되는 두 가지 커피 콩은 아라비카와 로부스타입니다. 현재는 아메리카 대륙, 동남아시아, 인도 아대륙, 아프리카의 적도 지역에서 70여 개국에서 재배되고 있습니다. 브라질은 세계 커피 생산의 35%를 차지하는 주요 생산국입니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "커피는 전 세계적으로 매년 수십억 달러의 판매량을 기록하지만, 커피 원두를 생산하는 농부들은 여전히 빈곤에 시달리고 있으며, 커피 재배와 물 사용으로 인한 환경적 문제도 지적되고 있습니다. 커피는 단순한 음료 그 이상으로, 문화와 경제에 깊은 영향을 미치는 중요한 상품이 되었습니다.\n",
