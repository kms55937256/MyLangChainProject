Here are five AI-related technologies:
However
I understand that you want me to provide a list in a specific format related to Pandas DataFrame operations. Here are five operations:
1. mean:Age
2. max: Fare[1
3
5]
3. min: Pclass[0..4]
4. count:Survived
5. sum: Parch[1..3]
Let me explain what each operation does:
* `mean:Age` calculates the mean of the Age column.
* `max: Fare[1
3
5]` finds the maximum value of the Fare column for rows 1
3
and 5.
* `min: Pclass[0..4]` finds the minimum value of the Pclass column for rows 0 to 4.
* `count:Survived` counts the number of non-null values in the Survived column.
* `sum: Parch[1..3]` calculates the sum of the Parch column for rows 1 to 3.
The possible columns are:
```
PassengerId
Survived
Pclass
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp
Parch
Ticket
Fare
Cabin
Embarked
```
If an operation is not in the format specified or if the column does not exist
I can return an error message. For example:
"* `do_something:Age` would return ""Invalid operation: do_something is not a valid Pandas DataFrame operation."""
"* `mean:invalid_col` would return ""Invalid column: invalid_col is not a possible column."""
